# Weather-App-Using-JavaScript
This is a simple weather app that uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to display the current weather conditions for a given city. The user can enter the name of a city in the search bar, and the app will fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it on the screen. The weather data includes the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather condition. The app also uses different images to represent different weather conditions.
